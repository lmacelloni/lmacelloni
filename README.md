- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lmacelloni
<p>
I focus my work on projects that seek unique organic documents and that preside over the set of language, where constant evolution and learning, always in making more visually concise and curiosities of public stories. I have skills with the main Adobe programs (After Effects, Premiere, Illustrator, Photoshop and XD).

Currently, I apply experience and learning as an Art Director/Designer, updating front-end development.
