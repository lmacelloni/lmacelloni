Hey, I'm Lucas â€” a visual strategist, creative director, and someone deeply curious about the intersection between artificial intelligence, symbolic systems, and visual storytelling.

I currently work at **Seven7th Brasil**, a growth marketing agency, where I explore how AI can co-create meaningful visual identities, enhance creative workflows, and challenge the boundaries between tool and language.

## Research Directions

I'm currently exploring:

- **Image as code**: Prompt engineering as a form of symbolic writing  
- **AI x Branding**: How intelligent agents can help maintain consistent brand voices and visuals  
- **Post-tool design**: Building workflows where AI acts less like a plugin, more like a co-creator  
- **Design QA**: Evaluating and training visual agents for quality and intent
